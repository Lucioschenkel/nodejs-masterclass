# Node.js Masterclass

This repository contains the source code of the main project developed during pirple's Nodejs Masterclass.
It consists of a REST api written in Javascript using only node's built in modules, and a simple GUI with some basic templating logic for variable interpolation inside the templates.
The "misc" folder contains some usage examples of modules that were not used in the API itselft, and were only introduced.
