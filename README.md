# Node.js Masterclass

This repository contains the source code of the project developed during pirple's Nodejs Masterclass. It consists of a REST API written in Javascript using only the node's built-in modules. It also includes a simple GUI with some basic templating logic for variable interpolation inside the templates. The "misc" folder contains some usage examples of modules not present in the API itself.
